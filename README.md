Simple Python-based student progress tracker Student Progress Tracker

A simple Python-based console application for tracking a student’s academic progress. This project focuses on basic Python fundamentals: variables, input/output, conditionals, and simple calculations. Nothing fancy, nothing overengineered.

If you’re expecting a full database-backed system or a web app, this isn’t it. This is a learning project, and it does exactly that.

FEATURES:

Collects basic student information

Accepts marks/scores for subjects

Calculates:

Total marks

Average score

Performance status (e.g., pass/fail)

Displays results in a clear console format

Project Structure MiniProject_Student ProgressTracker.ipynb

The logic is written inside a Jupyter Notebook

Code behaves like a standard Python script when run top-to-bottom

No external files, no dependencies, no hidden magic

Requirements

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)

That’s it. If you don’t have Python installed, fix that first.

How to Run Option 1: Jupyter Notebook (Recommended)

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/pothusuryateja-cpu/student-progress-report.git

Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook MiniProject_Student ProgressTracker.ipynb

Run all cells in order

Option 2: Convert to Python Script

If you actually understand Python:

Copy the code into a .py file

Run it using:

python student_progress.py

Example Output
STUDENT PROGRESS TRACKER SYSTEM
Name: John Doe Total Marks: 420 Average: 84.0 Status: Pass

Clean, readable, and does the job.

Purpose of This Project

Let’s be clear:

This is not production-ready software

This is not scalable

This is not a resume-defining project

What it is:

Practice with Python basics

Logical flow control

Console-based interaction

A stepping stone to better projects

If you stop here, you’re wasting time. Use this as a foundation and move on.

Possible Improvements (You Should Do These)

If you want this project to actually matter:

Add functions instead of writing everything inline

Add input validation (right now it trusts the user blindly)

Store multiple students using lists or dictionaries

Add file handling (save/load student records)

Convert it into a CLI tool or a web app
